# Introduction

The **GPT-3 Leukemia Information Assistant** is an open-source **proof of concept** application developed using the OpenAI API beta. The project is a HIAS AI Agent meaning it can be connected to the HIAS Network and can provide user interfaces with on demand information about Leukemia.

&nbsp;

# DISCLAIMER

This project is a proof of concept and demonstrates a possible medical use case for GPT-3.

**This project is not to be used to provide medical information in the real world.**

The information provided by this project may not be factually correct.

&nbsp;

# Motivation

The motivation for this project is to see how GPT-3 could be used as a potential medical information source for leukemia.

&nbsp;

# Leukemia

Leukemia is a blood cancer characterized by a rapid production of abnormal white blood cells called blasts.  In 2020, almost 500,000 new patients were diagnosed with leukemia all over the world and approximately 312,000 individuals died with this disease. In the United States, there are over 60,000 new cases every year, and over 24,000 patients die from leukemia annually.

# GPT-3

GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) uses state of the deep learning to produce human-like text for natural language understanding applications. The language prediction model is exposed via the OpenAI API Beta, a new offering from OpenAI that allows developers to implement state of the art language predictions into their applications.

Thank you to OpenAI for providing early access to the beta making this project possible.
